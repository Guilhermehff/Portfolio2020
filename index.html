        <h1 id="isuna">Isuna</h1>
        <p>Isuna is a module based organization tool that helps cosplayers cover every aspect of their costume, from the planning to the note taking and final result.
        </p>

        <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
        <p>The project consisted of creating an application for the iOS platform within the Apple Developer Academy | Senac with a team of 1 Product Designer and 2 iOS developers. After several meetings around the theme, we arrived at the cosplay
          market, which consists of creating clothing focused on characters from series, games, movies, etc. </p>
        <p>We saw here the possibility of an audience that spends a large part of their time and money on these costumes but does not have any type of application that meets their creative or dissemination process. </p>
        <p>We then started with an immersion process that was summarized in 3 steps: </p>

        <ul>
          <li><span>Face-to-face interviews</span> with cosplayers to find possible needs within this market. </li>

          <li><span>Quantitative forms</span> distributed in national and international communities. This survey was created based on the insights gained during the first interviews and led to a higher mapping of the market. </li>

          <li><span>Interviews through Discord, Skype and WhatsApp</span> with cosplayers acquired through the forms. This interview had a more specific character, focusing on problems already encountered in the previous steps. Both casual
            cosplayers and influencers with more than 10,000 followers on social media were interviewed.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <img id="isuna-map" src="images/isuna-map.svg" alt="Map of the world with the main interviewed countries highlighted">

      <div class="project-content-container">

        <h2 id="modular-app">Modular App</h2>
        <p>After immersion, we noticed the amount of different media that exist for organizing and planning a cosplay, without consensus among the public. Individual interviewees went so far as to adapt completely different tools to their
          needs. We note here an untapped niche that had high chances of success and sustainability as an application. </p>
        <p>We started to conceive the idea, with a new phase of interviews it was possible to structure the process of creating cosplay from several different profiles and thus have a more excellent knowledge of how to meet this need. After
          meetings, benchmarks and conversations with the public, we decided to go for a <span>modular app that fit each user's unique organizational need. </span></p>
        <p>The app allows the user to register a cosplay with its primary information and from that moment, choose which module he wants to use to catalogue various details. The user could, for example, create a cosplay using only the notes and
          images module and exclude the module that focuses on the financial part of the process. </p>
        <p>We established an MVP with the main modules for an initial launch based on the information architecture we created with cosplayers, in addition to mapping future expansions to meet what our audience considered essential. This allowed
          the creation of the flow and wireframes of information that would guide the development of the application. </p>

      </div>

      <img id="isuna-architecture" src="images/isuna-architecture.png" alt="Architecture of the cosplay process">

      <div class="project-content-container">

        <h2 id="design-system">Design system</h2>
        <p>Before the screens were produced, the definition of a visual identity for the application was necessary, essential for the creation of a consistent design system. We can divide this into 4 main points. </p>

      </div>
      <img id="isuna-branding" src="images/isuna-branding.png" alt="isuna logo, typography, iconography and colour palette">

      <div class="project-content-container">
        <ul>
          <li><span>The Brand</span> was inspired by Japanese culture. Based on the origins of the cosplay name, Isuna emerged as a combination of the words <span>I</span>shō (costume), Kyōyū <span>Su</span>ru (Share) and
            Kurieitibu<span>na</span> (Creativity). This method of conjunction is
            regular in the Japanese language and was the same used for the creation of kosupure - cosplay in Japanese.</br>Also, the logo refers to a fox mask, known in Japanese culture by the name Kitsune and as a being that changes its shape.
          </li>
          <li><span>The Palette</span> was developed with the idea of using colour-coding within the various elements that make up a cosplay. It has a version for light and dark mode.</li>
          <li><span>The typography</span> needed to accommodate the interface with different texts, due to the large amount of content generated by the user within the application. </li>
          <li><span>The iconography</span> of the project was peculiar in that it demonstrated several types of different audiences that have access to cosplay, to bring as much representation as possible. For this purpose, wheelchair users and
            others can be added as required by the public.</li>
        </ul>

      </div>


      <div class="project-content-container">

        <h2 id="result">Result</h2>
        <p>The next step was the creation of high-fidelity and handoff screens for development. The whole process was done with the developers in mind, allowing a smooth and hassle-free handoff. </p>


      </div>

      <img id="isuna-screens" src="images/isuna-screens.png" alt="4 different isuna app screens">

      <div class="project-content-container">

        <h2 id="insights">Insights</h2>
        <p>The app was first launched on the Testflight platform for usability testing and feedback from other members of the academy, to correct or add essential functionality for a successful launch. Besides, the app was advertised at events
          related to the cosplay area to acquire interest and contacts for dissemination. </p>
        <p>After the launch, the focus shifted to bug fixing and improving the base product for the community. Implementation of analytics and firebase helped immensely in this process, in addition to new meetings with influencers in the area.
          As a unified community, staying in contact with these individuals was of the utmost importance. </p>
        <p>Throughout the entire process of creating Isuna, learning how to create a doable MVP was a significant challenge that we managed to overcome. This allowed us to create a consistent product that would enable future updates easily due
          to the modular nature of the project. </p>
        <p>Also, leading a team from the initial design to the end has produced incredible insights into the design process as a whole. The possibility of conducting interviews at an international level due to the nature of the project, in
          particular, helped to see different perspectives on a product with worldwide options. </p>

        <h2>Thank you</h2>
        <p>For reading and taking your time to see my work, you can find Isuna on the app store. We hope to bring more updates on the future.</p>
